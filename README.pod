CPAN Meta Browser

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CPAN Meta Browser is a two-part application for convenient access to metadata
for the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). The first part is a
C<refresh> command which will download this metadata and index it into the
selected backend database. The second part is a web application which provides
search functionality into the indexed database.

  /path/to/cpan-meta-browser.pl refresh
  hypnotoad /path/to/cpan-meta-browser.pl

The C<Module Index Search> searches the CPAN packages index, which is the file
L<02packages.details.txt|https://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt>.
This is the canonical mapping of module name to the latest authorized stable
release of that module, maintained by PAUSE and used by CPAN installers when
given a module to install.

The C<Permissions Search> searches the PAUSE permissions database, which is the
file L<06perms.txt|https://www.cpan.org/modules/06perms.txt>. This is the
listing of authors that can upload new stable releases of a module and have it
indexed, and that can modify the permissions for that module name. The
C<first-come> permission, granted to the first user to upload a module name,
has ultimate authority on the name, and can add or remove any other user's
permissions. The C<permission manager> permission can add or remove other
C<co-maint> permissions. The C<co-maint> permission can only remove their own
permission. Note that these module permissions are B<not> hierarchical. An
author must have permissions for each individual module name they wish to have
indexed.

The C<Author Search> searches the CPAN authors database, which is the file
L<00whois.xml|https://www.cpan.org/authors/00whois.xml>. This contains
public details of the PAUSE accounts.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Perl v5.20.0 or higher is required. Perl dependencies are listed in
F<cpanfile>. They can be installed by running:

  cpanm --installdeps .

=head1 CONFIGURATION

CPAN Meta Browser is configured by the file F<cpan-meta-browser.conf> in the
application home directory. The configuration file is a Perl hash. The
C<hypnotoad> key will be used to configure
L<Hypnotoad|Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad/SETTINGS> if it is used to start the web
application.

There are three backends available for CPAN Meta Browser. The backend can be
set as C<backend> in the configuration file, or C<CPAN_META_BROWSER_BACKEND> in
the environment.

The default backend is C<sqlite> and requires L<Mojo::SQLite>. C<sqlite_path>
may be set to a file path to store the database (must be in a writable
directory, defaults to F<cpan-meta.sqlite> in the application home directory).

The C<pg> backend requires L<Mojo::Pg> and a PostgreSQL server running at least
version 9.6, with the C<pg_trgm> extension. This is usually packaged in the
C<-contrib> package for PostgreSQL and must be installed in the database that
will be used:

  CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;

C<pg_url> must also be set to a database connection URL in the form
C<postgresql://user:password@host:port/database>.

The C<redis> backend requires L<Mojo::Redis> and a Redis server running at least
version 3.2.0. C<redis_url> may be set to a database connection URL in the form
C<redis://x:auth@host:port/database> (defaults to C<redis://localhost:6379/0>).

=head1 API

In addition to the browser interface, CPAN Meta Browser provides an API to the
contents of the files it indexes. The endpoints below are relative to the
installation path, such as L<https://cpanmeta.grinnz.com/>. All endpoints
return JSON, and the module and author parameters are case insensitive and trim
surrounding whitespace.

See the L<API documentation|https://grinnz.github.io/cpan-meta-browser/api.html>
for details.
